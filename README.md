#ReversiDuel

A Java clone of **GomokuDuel**, except that Gomoku's changed to Reversi.

I tried to make this "clone" as similar to its original as possible, but due to framework limits differences exist.

This project is based on JavaFX 8. Below is a list of third-party frameworks used:
- JFoenix: https://github.com/jfoenixadmin/JFoenix
- DataFX 8: https://bitbucket.org/datafx/datafx/
- Material Icons 2.2.0: https://bitbucket.org/Jerady/fontawesomefx

To build this project, you need to have gradle installed. Then run:
```bash
gradle run
```
And this should do the job. I think.
(Gradle processes could take really long, please have patience and make sure you aren't blocked by firewalls)
